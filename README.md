# Business-Card-Data-Extraction-using-OCR

Image Upload and Display:

Users upload business card images (PNG, JPEG, JPG).
The code likely uses OpenCV to load and display images.
2. Text Extraction with OCR:

The easyocr library extracts text from images.
It identifies text regions and their bounding boxes.
3. Data Extraction and Organization:

The code extracts specific details (name, company, email, etc.) using regular expressions or text patterns.
It organizes extracted data into a dictionary for further processing.
4. DataFrame Creation:

A pandas DataFrame is created from the extracted data, making it easier to manage and analyze.
5. Database Interaction:

Users can optionally store data in a database (likely PostgreSQL based on psycopg2 usage).
The code constructs SQL queries to insert data into a table.
It uses placeholders (?) for values to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
6. Data Retrieval and Display:

Stored card data can be retrieved and displayed for viewing or further actions.
Additional Insights:

Error Handling: Error handling mechanisms would improve robustness.
Data Validation: Validating extracted data before storage ensures integrity.
Image Preprocessing: Preprocessing images (e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion) can enhance OCR accuracy.
User Experience: A user-friendly interface (e.g., Streamlit) would make the application more accessible.
Data Cleaning: Techniques to address missing or incorrect values could improve data quality.
